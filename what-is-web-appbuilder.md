## When to use Web AppBuilder

- Good for:
  - Multi-purpose apps that need to run on multiple devices
  - Creating a suite of custom apps with consistent style/behavior
  - Empowering non-devlopers to create apps
- Other frameworks/templates might be better for:
  - Specific, custom web apps, with specialized workflows
  - When there is a template that does almost all of app functionality
