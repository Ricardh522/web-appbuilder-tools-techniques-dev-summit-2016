 * Automating file management and integration with version control systems using Grunt
 * Scaffolding widgets using Yeoman generators
 * Writing widgets that use modern JavaScript that can be tested and used outside of the Web AppBuilder

## 2015 Talk
This talk will address some of the same concepts as last year, but tactically build and expand on those ideas! Last years slides are at [tomwayson/web-appbuilder-tools-techniques-dev-summit-2015](https://github.com/tomwayson/web-appbuilder-tools-techniques-dev-summit-2015).
